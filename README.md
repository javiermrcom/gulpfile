## gulpfile

You can use this *gulpfile* to your projects. You only have to change the value of *path* variable.

``` javascript
var path = {
  dist: {
    styles: 'public/css',
    scripts: 'public/js'
  },
  src: {
    styles: 'resources/assets/scss',
    scripts: 'resources/assets/js'
  }
};
```
